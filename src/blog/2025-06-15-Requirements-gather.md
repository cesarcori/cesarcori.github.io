As a full-stack developer, I've found that maintaining thorough
documentation during the requirements stage is an invaluable practice.

It's often impossible to predict if a project will need to scale.
In such situation, having a clear record of why a particular
feature was created or why a client requested something specific
is necessary.

My first step in understanding the full scope of a client's problem
and needs is to hold a comprehensive meeting with them. While many
resources recommend recording all meetings, I've found that some
clients prefer not to be recorded. In these cases, active listening
becomes crucial (I think that is important if you record or not). 
It's essential to be fully concentrated and take detailed notes to
capture the entirety of the interview.

I am interested in learning about alternative methods you use to
gather key information from clients.

As a programmer, my natural inclination is to start coding immediately.
However, I have come to appreciate the importance of this initial stage.
These meetings are vital for understanding the client's challenges
and gaining a better command of their business processes

Adhering to this first step can sometimes be challenging, but it is
necessary and correct part of the process. I would be interested
to hear how you begin this phase of your work. I will be sharing 
more of my development experiences with you

Thank you for reading.
